            <p>
            Your personal data will be transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), including the UK, and, in some cases, the laws of these countries do not provide the same level of protection of your personal data as those in the UK. For example, we transfer personal data to our corporate affiliates, located in the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

Copies of the Standard Contractual Clauses we use to facilitate the transfer of data outside the EEA are available here and here.

For example, we need to keep records about our members’ purchase histories in order to honour our returns policy. If you want to return an item you bought from us several years ago, we need to be able to confirm when and where you bought it. For this reason, we generally keep records about our members’ accounts and purchase histories for a minimum of 10 years. In addition, when you consent to receive marketing communications from us, we retain your email address and information about your marketing preferences for the duration of your membership, unless you opt out of receiving such communications or terminate your membership.</p>
